From what I understand about the job, it's a position that requires a 
lot of fast activity during the day, and that's the kind of job I thrive
 in. I love to stay busy and wear a lot of hats. Is my assessment of the
 environment on target?
<br><br>
What if I share my impression of the role and see if I've got a good 
handle on it — is that okay? Great! Well, it seems that this job is very
 connected to the inventory system and your part-number database.
<br><br>
It sounds like your new hire will go to weekly Production meetings and 
make sure that every part you require for the next week's production 
schedule is on hand, or if it isn't, to fix that problem! When suppliers
 switch out parts or re-number them, this person will make sure the 
database gets updated. Did I cover the most important points?
<br><br>
Honestly I'd have a hard time saying truthfully "You should hire me!" 
because you are going to meet or have already met the other candidates, 
and of course I haven't met them.
<br><br>
I would only say that I'm excited about your company and its prospects, 
 I've been working in Inventory Control and Production Planning very 
successfully and I love it, and if I seem like the right person for the 
job I'd be very excited to continue the conversation.
<br><br>
If I come and work here it will be my third job in Inventory Control. 
The reason I like Inventory Control and Production Planning is because 
it deals with real things — parts and finished products — not strictly 
numbers in spreadsheets.
<br><br>
I like to work with real things. I like to organize inventory systems 
and see products coming off the assembly line. That's why I'm drawn to 
manufacturing jobs.
<br><br>
Earlier in our conversation you mentioned that it's a challenge keeping 
parts on hand for products that you only build in small quantities. In 
my last job I set up a system with the suppliers for our low-quantity 
parts, because it would be very easy for us to slip off those suppliers'
 radar screens.
<br><br>
I maintained a dashboard that showed us when we were running low on any 
of those low-quantity parts because we needed more lead time to get 
those orders turned around and delivered to us. As a result of the 
dashboard, we were seldom if ever out of stock on those products. I love
 to spot the most time-consuming and irritating production problem in 
any company and solve it first.

In quite a few recent blog posts (here, here and here), the Hyrell team 
and I have taken a look inside the interview process. While researching 
and putting this information together, we discussed many good questions 
that can/should be asked during a typical job interview.  And, we also 
noted that the candidate should have their own interview questions in 
order to get a better sense of the company, the culture, and what kind 
of fit they will be in the organization. 
<br><br>
Coincidentally, I had recent conversation with a well-qualified 
job-seeking friend &amp; colleague. We talked about the job search, the 
interview process, and what was the right move for him.  We began to 
discuss why he would work for any of the companies that were interested 
in him, and it became clear to me that we shared the same view that many
 qualified applicants are beginning to embrace: “Why Should I Work For 
YOU?”
<br><br>
Sure, money and health benefits have always been a key driver in the 
decision to accept or reject a job - and for many people that is still 
the key decision point. However, as their careers become their lives, 
there are a growing number of people that want to ensure the proper 
work-life-balance and ultimately find fulfilment. 
<br><br>
Take my friend for example: He is exceptionally (and somewhat uniquely) 
qualified for the career path he is on. But it’s simply not just about 
the money for him. As he told me, “All the money in the world isn’t 
worth it if I am not enjoying with what I am doing.” — maybe that alone 
is what makes him unique.  I pressed to see what would make a job worth 
it — better medical benefits? Free beer Fridays? Access to the corporate
 jet? (There was no jet.)  It was none of those things. 
<br><br>
It came to down to whether the company was a good fit for his 
personality, his interests, and his work ethic/style.  He wanted to work
 at a place that challenged him every day. Where he wasn’t the smartest 
guy in the room, but still got to be a leader and teacher. He wanted to 
work at place that thrived on creativity, teamwork, and learning, but 
also gave him the freedom to work autonomously to get the job done. He 
wanted to work somewhere that collaborated well, but didn’t require 5 
staff meetings and 6 conference calls a week to do it. He wanted to have
 the freedom to work from a coffee shop, the park, or even from home in 
his PJs. He’s not a typical idealist (or even a millennial for that 
matter), he’s just a guy who knows how to do his job really well and 
feels he should be able to have a choice in where he does this job and 
who he does it for.
<br><br>
I told him he was looking for a needle in a haystack - that companies 
like that rarely exist outside the pages of Inc. Magazine - but it stuck
 with me over the next few days following our conversation.
<br><br>
And so I asked around - friends, co-workers, mentors, interns - it 
didn’t matter, I was curious. Overwhelmingly, the responses (while not 
exactly as lofty as my friend) were very similar. People wanted to feel a
 connection to the place that they worked, the people they worked with 
and the job that they were asked to do.  So I took to this blog to 
remind hiring mangers: The next time you ask a candidate why you should 
hire them, keep in mind, they’re probably trying to figure out why they 
should work for YOU.
